Description: `aquaGHG` is an easy-to-use and generic package with the
    objective to provide reproducible calculation of GHG fluxes from
    static or floating chamber measurements in aquatic ecosystems.
    `aquaGHG` provides the option to i) either manually inspect the gas
    measurements, select the valid observations and proceed with
    subsequent flux calculation using both linear (LM) and non-linear
    flux, or ii) automatically process the data without any manual step,
    from raw incubation timeseries to flux estimates to minimize users
    biases during data selection.  When CH4 measurements are available in
    the data input, `aquaGHG` allows for automatic detection of bubbling
    events. A flux separation method is included, allowing to estimate
    total, diffuse, and ebullition fluxes, along with uncertainty
    assessment.
